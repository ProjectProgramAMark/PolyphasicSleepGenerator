This is a little calculator I built to help people that want to calculate quickly what times naps and core sleep should be taken for Polyphasic sleep cycles. Currently only supporting Everyman3 but I hope to add more compatibility! Works through terminal for now but should be building a GUI later on.

Thanks for using!
